# MVP notebooks

MVP stands for 'minimum viable product' - a term I am borrowing from software development and start-up philosophy (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)). The idea is to get a basic version of your product up and working fast, with the minimum possible complexity, so that you can then learn from the outcome and iterate effectively. In our case, the outcome is model performance rather than customer feedback, but the philosophy is the same.

Another related concept from software development that applies: [premature optimization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/385506/when-is-optimisation-premature). Spending hours 'improving' your data before you have the ability quantify the effect of doing so is a trap. One of the keys to efficiency in this course's data science projects is to not get bogged down in the preparations for model training. Get the model working so that you can evaluate it, then work on adding to your EDA/data cleaning/feature engineering so you can do so in a meaningful way.

The MVP notebooks in this list will give you a skeleton outline of what should be included in your solution at minimum, and a few hints on how to approach the novel/tricky parts along the way.
